## Hall Sensor-based Trapezoidal Commutation for BLDC Motor with Hall Sequence Identifier : MCLV-48V-300W and dsPIC33AK512MC510 Motor Control DIM


## 1. INTRODUCTION
This document describes the setup requirements for driving a Brushless DC (BLDC) Motor using trapezoidal commutation with Hall Sensor feedback and a Hall sequence identifier on the hardware platform [EV18H47A](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev18h47a) "MCLV-48V-300W Development Board"  and [EV67N21A](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev67n21a) "dsPIC33AK512MC510 Motor Control Dual In-line Module (DIM)".

For details about trapezoidal commutation of BLDC motor using Hall Sensor feedback, refer to Microchip application note [AN957](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/aemDocuments/documents/OTH/ApplicationNotes/ApplicationNotes/BLDCMC00957a.pdf) “Sensored BLDC Motor Control”. The Hall sequence identifier detects correct sequences of Hall and phase connections, allowing users the flexibility to connect Hall and phase wires in any order.

This application utilizes the Configurable Logic Cell (CLC) module of the dsPIC Digital Signal Controllers (DSCs) to detect changes in the Hall sensor sector, while utilizing the input capture feature of the Capture/Compare/PWM (CCP) peripheral to accurately measure time intervals for speed calculation. A simplified logic circuit and its truth table are provided below. For more detailed information, please refer to section [7 Appendix](#7-appendix).

 ## 7. APPENDIX
 The CLC and SCCP peripherals of the dsPIC are configured to detect sector transitions from the Hall sensors and to measure speed. The CLC is set up to generate a pulse train based on the Gray code pattern obtained from the combination of three Hall sensors. The period of this pulse train can be measured using the input capture and timer features of the SCCP module. The configuration of the CLC peripheral for generating a pulse train from the Hall sensor Gray code is illustrated in the figure below.
